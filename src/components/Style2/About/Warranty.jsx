                <h3>TWO-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY</h3>
                <p>Endro Scientific Warranty Terms and Conditions</p>
                <h3><strong>WARRANTY REGISTRATION REQUIRED</strong></h3>
                <p>To ensure your warranty coverage, please register your unit within 30 days of receiving it. This registration is mandatory for both the 
                  standard 2-year warranty and the extended 2+3-year warranty, applicable to all Endro Scientific units featuring our Monoblock technology.</p>
                <p><strong><em>All Endro Scientific units purchased after November 6, 2023, require an ongoing connection to the VPL that is shipped complimentary with the 
                  unit for the full warranty to be in effect. &nbsp;Connection to the VPL and VitalLog Cloud is required throughout the warranty period to 
                  improve the speed of service and ensure an accurate diagnosis of any warranty claim.&nbsp; Preventive maintenance is also required. </em></strong></p>
                <h3>CATASTROPHIC FAILURES</h3>
                <p>If a catastrophic failure occurs, such as a compressor failure, Endro Scientific will replace the appliance free of charge within two years from 
                  your original purchase date. The replacement appliance carries the original warranty end date.</p>
                <h3>MINOR REPAIRS AND MALFUNCTIONS</h3>
                <p>Endro Scientific appliances also carry two-year parts and a labor-limited warranty. This warranty period begins on the original purchase date. 
                  It includes replacing parts or the entire unit if necessary and in Endro Scientific's sole discretion when problems arise due to defective 
                  workmanship or materials. The buyer is responsible for maintaining the appliance according to the operations manual. Keeping records of such 
                  maintenance helps ensure warranty repair claims. Any failure to properly maintain any appliance voids this warranty.</p>
                <h3>EXCLUSIONS</h3>
                <p>This warranty does not cover the following: Appliances without original identifying manufacturer serial numbers. Appliances sold via a 
                  third party as a "used" product, without original sales receipts and original packaging. Appliances shipped outside of the United States, 
                  including Mexico and Canada. Due to any refrigerator or freezer failure, commercial product inventory includes but is not limited to vaccines, 
                  reagents, tissue samples, breast milk, blood, plasma, industrial products, food, or any other payload. Endro Scientific is not responsible for the contents 
                  held in storage. Appliances used in residential settings. Bills of Lading signed without inspection of freight and notation of damage. Cosmetic 
                  damage caused by shipment or installation and not reported within 24 hours of delivery. The original packaging should be maintained until the 
                  unit is entirely accepted and cleared for service in the environment to ensure safe return shipping in the event of failure. A replacement kit 
                  for return shipping will incur an additional charge if the packaging is not retained during installation. Unauthorized service calls. Unauthorized 
                  modification to the unit, including adjustments to administrative parameters. Damage occurring during installation after BOL (Bills of Lading) 
                  has an acceptance signature. Appliance failure due to an electrical surge. Unauthorized reseller purchases. Damages or loss due to Acts of God</p>
                <h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>
                <p>Endro Scientific shall not be liable for consequential or incidental damage, including but not limited to property damage and unexpected 
                  expenses, resulting from any breach of this written limited warranty or any implied warranty. Some states and provinces do not allow the 
                  exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages. If You Need Service</p>
