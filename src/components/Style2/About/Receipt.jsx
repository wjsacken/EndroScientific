                <h2>We thoroughly inspect your unit before it ships. Freight damage occurs infrequently, but it does happen. Please help us protect your investment by receiving your 
                  new unit(s) with attention to detail.</h2>
                <p>Please review and document damage during delivery to avoid liability for return shipping and repair costs. We want to make sure that doesn't happen. Please ensure you 
                  or the assigned receiving party thoroughly review this unit before the freight company arrives. We can only file claims for freight damage if you identify and note the bill of lading (BOL and/or delivery paperwork) and ensure the delivery driver accepts and signs.</p>
                <p>Things to look for and note on the BOL:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A broken pallet may mean your unit has been dropped and can cause internal damage.</li>
                  <li>Tilt meters indicate that the unit has not remained upright in transit or has experienced a high degree of impact during transit.</li>
                  <li>Box crushing, holes, or tears in the outer packaging.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You have the right to refuse&nbsp;all&nbsp;or part of your shipment based on the damage that will ultimately mean you want or need a replacement unit.</p>
                <p>Refusing delivery, while inconvenient, will speed up the process of your new unit arriving. If you are still determining if you should accept the unit, please call 
                  Endro Scientific at <a href="tel:7047971469">(704) 797 1469</a>, option 2, for assistance Monday - Friday 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. 
                  Please note in the BOL that the outer packaging is damaged, and you must complete a full inspection. Remember, you must report any concealed damage within 48 business hours.</p>
                <p>Take photos of the damage, including packaging, and send a copy of the images and noted BOL to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:brannon@endrosci.com">brannon@endrosci.com</a>. We will look over 
                this and respond within 24 business hours.</p>
                <h3>What if the carrier won't wait for me to inspect the freight?</h3>
                <p>Please note the bill of lading (BOL) with "driver refused to wait for inspection to be completed" and have them initial the BOL. You should photograph any 
                  damage found and send the photos and any other description of malfunction to <a href="mailto:brannon@endrosci.com">brannon@endrosci.com</a>.</p>
                <h3>What if my unit looks okay but is not functioning correctly once plugged in?</h3>
                <p>Call&nbsp;<a href="tel:7047971469">(704) 797 1469</a>, option 2, or engage with one of our technicians using our online chat feature.</p>
                <h3>What if I have warranty-related issues during the first 24 months of ownership?</h3>
