              <h2>It is our goal to ship each order accurately. When mistakes happen, we will correct the problem promptly. Take a few minutes to review our policy to ensure our prompt 
                service and your desired positive outcome.</h2>
              <p>Please report any issues within two (2) business days of receipt. Errors may include shipment of the wrong quantity or type of unit, failure to complete a scheduled pick-up or 
                  concealed freight damage.&nbsp;</p>
              <h3><strong>SHIPPING AND CONCEALED DAMAGE&nbsp;</strong></h3>
              <p>Please refer to the Endro Scientific’s Receipt of Goods policy to ensure your shipping protection is not voided. All deliveries require a dated signature by the delivery driver and your 
                company’s receiving representative on the Bill of Lading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>You must note any damage to the packaging. If the damage to the packaging is severe, you can either complete an inspection while the driver is still there or note on the bill of lading 
                that a full inspection is pending because of concealed damage concerns. When damage to the packaging is severe, we recommend refusal of the unit to help speed the replacement process and save you the repackaging effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>A signed, clean bill of lading removes any ability for Endro Scientific to hold the shipping partner responsible for the damage that occurs in transit and therefore voids your shipment protection 
                and the warranty replacement. Please don't let your unit go uninspected. Concealed damage must be reported within two (2) business days.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Note: Please ensure you have measured your doorways and space before placing your order to ensure it's a good fit and pain-free delivery. If a unit ships and will not fit through 
                your doors upright, I need special handling instructions. If the unit arrives and cannot be delivered because it will not fit through your doorways. The customer is responsible for 
                shipping charges or any special services required to complete a delivery or pick-up. If a unit must be laid down to be delivered, please notify Endro Scientific for special instructions. 
                The unit must rest upright in the final location for at least 24 hours to allow the refrigerant to settle back to proper positioning for the start-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <h3><strong>GENERAL POLICY&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

                please request a cancellation, not a return. Just to let you know, written cancellation with confirmation from Endro Scientific is required to ensure your unit does not ship 
                and that you will not be held responsible for return fees. Please call Endro Scientific at 800-218-7613 for assistance with your cancellation. If your unit has already shipped, 
                you must process a return.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
